class Puppeteer:
    """Agendas-based dialog bot.

    A Puppeteer instance is responsible for handling all aspects of the computer's side of the conversation, making
    decisions on conversational (or other) actions to take based on the conversational state and, possibly, other
    information about the world. There is a one-to-one relationship between Puppeteers and conversations, i.e., a
    Puppeteer handles a single conversation, and a conversation is typically handled by a single Puppeteer.

    A Puppeteer delegates most of its responsibilities to other classes, most notably:
    - Agenda: The Puppeteer's behavior is largely defined by a set of agendas associated with the Puppeteer. An
        Agenda can be described as a dialog mini-bot handling a specific topic or domain of conversation with a very
        specific and limited goal, e.g., getting to know the name of the other party. A Puppeteer's conversational
        abilities are thus defined by the collective abilities of the Agendas it can use.
    - PuppeteerPolicy: A PuppeteerPolicy is responsible for picking an agenda to use based on the conversational state,
        switching between agendas when appropriate. The choice of policy can be made through the Puppeteer's
        constructor, with the DefaultPuppeteerPolicy class as the default choice if no other class is specified.

    Architecturally, the Puppeteer is implemented much as a general agent, getting information about the world through
    observations and reacting by selecting actions appropriate for some goal. Its main purpose is to be used as a dialog
    bot, but could probably be used for other purposes as well.

    A Puppeteer session consists of first creating the Puppeteer, defining its set of agendas and its policy. Then the
    conversation is simply a series of turns, each turn having the following sequence of events:
        1. The other party acts, typically some kind of conversational action.
        2. The implementation surrounding the Puppeteer registers the actions of the other party, and possibly other
           useful information about the world.
        3. The information gathered is fed to the Puppeteer through its react() method. The Puppeteer chooses a sequence
           of actions to take based on the information.
        4. The surrounding implementation takes the Puppeteer's action, and realizes them, typically providing some kind
           of reply to the other party.
