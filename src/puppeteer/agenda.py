    The policy is controlled by the following parameters:
    - absolute_accept_thresh:
        If we reach an acceptance state with more than this confidence, we are done.
    - min_accept_thresh_w_differential:
        The min threshold for considering confidence we've reached a terminus. If we update the state machine often, our
        confidence prob in each state can get diffused across multiple states over long input sequences. So if we are
        accept_thresh_differential more likely than other states, and above min_accept_thresh_w_differential, we
        consider ourselves done.
    - accept_thresh_differential:
        The relative threshold between a candidate terminus and the next likely state. Probabilities "bleed out" over
        multiple transitions (e.g., the longer the input sequences, the more likely we'll get confidence/probability
        spread across multiple states), so relative probabilities are important.
    - kickoff_thresh:
        If we have an kickoff trigger with at least this confidence, we consider the kickoff condition triggered.

    The following two parameters are included in the class, but not currently in use by the policy:
    - reuse
        True if we can keep using this agenda in the same conversation.
    - max_transitions

class Agenda:
    """Class defining agenda behavior.

    An Agenda object completely defines the behavior of an agenda. This includes:
    - The name of the agenda.
    - The agenda's state graph with:
      - States, also defining start and terminus states
      - Triggers for state transitions and kickoff
      - State transitions.
    - Trigger detectors for both kickoff and state transitions. These should implement trigger detection for:
      - All state transition triggers defined by the state graph.
      - All of the agenda's kickoff triggers.
    - All actions used by the agenda.
    - Action mappings defining which actions are applicable in which states. This mapping are divided into a normal
      action map that is used in situations where the conversation is going well, and a stall action map that is used
      when the conversation has stalled.
    - A policy class used by the agenda to make decisions regarding things like action selection. This is specified by
      providing a subclass of AgendaPolicy when creating an Agenda, either to the constructor, or the load() method.
    - A trigger probability handling class used by the agenda to keep track of trigger probabilities. This is specified
      by providing a subclass of TriggerProbabilities when creating an Agenda, either to the constructor, or the load()
      method.
    - A state probability handling class used by the agenda to keep track of state probabilities. This is specified by
      providing a subclass of StateProbabilities when creating an Agenda, either to the constructor, or the load()
      method.

    Note that an Agenda object only defines agenda behavior and does not store any conversation-level state. The same
    Agenda object can be used by different concurrently running conversations.

    An Agenda object can be created in two different ways:
    - Creating an object using the Agenda() constructor. The resulting object is a mostly empty agenda that must be
      further defined by calling its various setter methods. In this mode of agenda creation, the user must make sure
      that all required agenda information is set in the object, before it is actually used in a conversation.
    - Loading an agenda from file using the load() method. In this case, the method returns a ready-to-use agenda.
